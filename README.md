# OptPack
OptPack is Optllizer's third custom track distribution. It has 448 custom tracks within 112 cups.

OptPack:
- Has most of all Pulsar's Features
- 480 Staff Ghosts
- New toggles like Display WWs Times, Pack Music, Classic SOM, and more.

Notes:
- My general coding knowledge is very limited, some code you see by me might be very inefficient or just plain wrong. 
- Some files will have notes for why or what I did to some code from Pulsar. 
- I should have gone down the route of having my own cpp and hpp files instead of directly modifying Pulsar, but I am far too deep. Maybe In the future I will swap over, but right now If it works it works.
- I will not provide any support with building or troubleshooting code. Again, I am very limited and won't be much help. Best advice is trial and error.
- If you find stuff you want to optimize or fix let me know, I am more than happy to implement them.
- This will not be updated retroactively with OptPack Updates. If I find the time to upload any new features or changes I will.


Updater:
- Very bare-bone updater that downloads files from a VPS.
- Most of the code is very inefficient but it works.
- I want to switch to curl or http 1.1 at some point to make it much faster, but the original source for sample http source is very limited.
- I will not provide any support with building or troubleshooting code. Again, I am very limited and won't be much help. Best advice is trial and error.
- If you find stuff you want to optimize or fix let me know, I am more than happy to implement them.
