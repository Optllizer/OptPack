# OptPack
OptPack is my third custom track distribution. It has 448 custom tracks within 112 cups. Built off of LE-Code than migrated over to Pulsar.

OptPack:
- Has most of all Pulsar's Features
- 480 Staff Ghosts
- New toggles like Display WWs Times, Pack Music, Classic SOM, and more.

Notes:
- My general coding knowledge is very limited, some code you see by me might be very inefficient or just plain wrong. 
- I will not provide any support with building or troubleshooting code. Again, I am very limited and won't be much help. Best advice is trial and error.
- If you find stuff you want to optimize or fix let me know, I am more than happy to implement them.
- This will not be updated retroactively with OptPack Updates. If I find the time to upload any new features or changes I will.
- To use, you need a clean build of Pulsar and CodeWarrior which I will not provide.
- This also does not include all files needed to run OptPack. For optpack download, get it from here [Wiki](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/OptPack) or[Discord](https://discord.gg/xgfscpmX2T)


Updater:
- Very bare-bone updater that downloads files from a VPS.
- Most of the code is very inefficient but it works.
- I want to switch to curl or http 1.1 at some point to make it much faster, but the original source for sample http source is very limited.
- I will not provide any support with building or troubleshooting code. Again, I am very limited and won't be much help. Best advice is trial and error.
- If you find stuff you want to optimize or fix let me know, I am more than happy to implement them.
